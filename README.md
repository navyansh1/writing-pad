1.  **Generate a GitHub Token:**
    *   Navigate to [GitHub's Personal Access Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) page.
    *   Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GuardNote Sync").
    *   Set an expiration date for the token.
    *   Under `Select scopes`, check the box next to **`gist`**. No other permissions are required.
    *   Click **Generate token** and copy the new token immediately.

2.  **Configure GuardNote:**
    *   In the GuardNote app, click the **`üîë Setup`** button in the header.
    *   A prompt will appear. Choose option `1` to set up cloud sync.
    *   Paste the GitHub token you just created and click OK.

3.  **Sync Your Notes:**
    *   **To Save:** To save your current notebooks to the cloud, click the **`‚òÅÔ∏è Sync`** button. This will create a new private Gist in your GitHub account or update an existing one.
    *   **To Load on a New Device:**
        1.  On your primary device (where notes are saved), go to `üîë Setup` and select option `3` to get your unique sync code (Gist ID).
        2.  On your new device, go to `üîë Setup`, select option `2`, and enter the sync code.
